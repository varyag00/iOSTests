TODO:

    -add animations to labels (and maybe button) -- DONE, but going to mess around with Spring
-NOTE: as of right now (02-11-2016), the cocoapods version of Spring pulls from an outdated branch, and thus I had to update my Podfile to 
        pod 'Spring', :git => 'https://github.com/MengTo/Spring.git', :branch => 'master'
    in order for builds to succeed

    Steps for Spring animations (using cocoapods)
    1. Create Spring view
    2. Add subviews to
